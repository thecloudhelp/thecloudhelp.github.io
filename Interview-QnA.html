          <br>What is the difference between Aura components and LWC? <br>Answer: Aura components are older and use a more complex programming model, whereas LWC is a more modern framework that uses web standards like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. <br>
          <br>What are the advantages of using LWC in Salesforce? <br>Answer: Some advantages of using LWC in Salesforce include better performance, improved security, and easier integration with third-party libraries. <br>
          <br>Can LWC be used outside of Salesforce? <br>Answer: Yes, LWC can be used outside of Salesforce, as it is a web component framework that is not specific to Salesforce. <br>
          <br>How do you pass data from parent to child in LWC? <br>Answer: To pass data from parent to child in LWC, you can use properties. You can define a property in the child component and then pass data to it from the parent component. <br>
          <br>How do you pass data from child to parent in LWC? <br>Answer: To pass data from child to parent in LWC, you can use events. You can define an event in the child component and then dispatch it to the parent component. <br>
          <br>How do you communicate between two LWC components? <br>Answer: To communicate between two LWC components, you can use events. You can define an event in one component and then dispatch it to the other component. <br>
          <br>How do you debug LWC components? <br>Answer: To debug LWC components, you can use the browser developer tools. You can set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code. <br>
          <br>What is the @wire decorator in LWC? <br>Answer: The @wire decorator in LWC is used to get data from an Apex method or a REST API. It makes it easy to fetch data and update the component when the data changes. <br>
          <br>How do you handle errors in @wire methods? <br>Answer: To handle errors in @wire methods, you can use the error property. You can define an error handler function in the component and then display an error message to the user. <br>
          <br>How do you call an Apex method from LWC? <br>Answer: To call an Apex method from LWC, you can use the @wire decorator. You can define a method in Apex and then use the @wire decorator to call it from the LWC component. <br>

          <br>What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression in JavaScript? <br>Answer: A function declaration is a statement that creates a named function, while a function expression creates a function that can be assigned to a variable. <br>
          <br>What is event bubbling in JavaScript? <br>Answer: Event bubbling is when an event occurs on a child element and then bubbles up through its parent elements, triggering any event listeners on the parent elements. <br>
          <br>What is event capturing in JavaScript? <br>Answer: Event capturing is the opposite of event bubbling, where an event starts at the top of the DOM tree and works its way down to the target element, triggering any event listeners on the way. <br>
          <br>How do you prevent default behavior in JavaScript events? <br>Answer: To prevent default behavior in JavaScript events, you can use the preventDefault() method. This method stops the default action from occurring, such as submitting a form or following a link. <br>
          <br>What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous HTTP requests? <br>Answer: Synchronous HTTP requests block the user interface until the request is complete, while asynchronous HTTP requests do not block the user interface and allow the user to continue interacting with the application. <br>
          <br>What is the difference between GET and POST requests in HTTP? <br>Answer: GET requests retrieve data from a server, while POST requests send data to a server to create or update a resource. <br>

          <br>What is async/await in JavaScript? <br>Answer: async/await is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, making it easier to read and understand. The async keyword is used to mark a function as asynchronous, and the await keyword is used to wait for a promise to resolve. <br>
          <br>What is a module in JavaScript? <br>Answer: A module in JavaScript is a self-contained unit of code that can be reused and imported into other modules. Modules help organize code and reduce code duplication. <br>

          <br>What is the spread syntax in JavaScript objects? <br>Answer: The spread syntax (...) in JavaScript objects is used to copy the properties of one object into another object, or to create a new object with some of the properties of an existing object. <br>
          <br>What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy in JavaScript objects? <br>Answer: A shallow copy of a JavaScript object copies only the object's properties, while a deep copy copies both the object's properties and the properties of its nested objects. <br>
          <br>What is the prototype chain in JavaScript? <br>Answer: The prototype chain in JavaScript is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from their prototype objects. <br>
          <br>What is the difference between call(), apply(), and bind() methods in JavaScript? <br>Answer: The call() and apply() methods in JavaScript are used to call a function with a specified this value and arguments, while the bind() method is used to create a new function with a specified this value, but does not execute the function immediately. <br>
          <br>What is hoisting in JavaScript? <br>Answer: Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes, allowing them to be used before they are declared. <br>
          <br>What is a closure in JavaScript? <br>Answer: A closure in JavaScript is a function that retains access to variables in its outer scope, even after the outer function has returned. <br>
          <br>What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript code? <br>Answer: Synchronous JavaScript code is executed in a single thread, and blocks the user interface until it completes, while asynchronous JavaScript code is executed in the background, and allows the user interface to remain responsive. <br>
          <br>What is the event loop in JavaScript? <br>Answer: The event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism that allows asynchronous JavaScript code to be executed in a non-blocking way, while still maintaining the order of execution. <br>

          <br>What is the difference between double equals (==) and triple equals (===) in JavaScript? <br>Answer: In JavaScript, double equals (==) compares two values for equality, and will attempt to convert the operands to the same type if they are not already of the same type. Triple equals (===) compares two values for equality, but does not perform any type conversion. <br>
          <br>What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions in JavaScript? <br>Answer: A synchronous function in JavaScript is a function that blocks the execution until it completes, while an asynchronous function allows other code to run while it is executing, and will typically return a Promise object. <br>
          <br>What is an arrow function in JavaScript? <br>Answer: An arrow function in JavaScript is a shorthand way of defining a function using the =&gt; operator. It has a concise syntax and a lexically scoped this keyword. <br>
